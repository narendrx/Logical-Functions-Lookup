        "       Logic: Checks if marks are 40 or higher.\n",

        "2. A company gives a bonus if sales are above 40,000 and attendance is greater than or equal to 90%. Write a formula to calculate whether the employee will get a bonus or not.\n",
        "    - Formula: =IF(AND(B2>40000, C2>=90), \"Bonus\", \"No Bonus\")\n",
        "     logic: Both conditions (Sales > 40k and Attendance ≥ 90%) must be true.\n",

        "      if marks in B2 are 9027550, otherwise fall\n",

        "       - Formula: =VLOOKUP(45000, A2:B5, 2, 1)\n",
        "         logic: Uses 1 (or TRUE) for an approximate match because 45,000 falls between the defined tiers (20,000 and 50,000).\n",

        "6. The HR department maintains the following leave records of employees:onus or not\n",
        "        - Formula: =IF(B2>C2, \"Exceeded\", \"OK\")\n",
        "          logic: Compares \"Leaves Taken\" against \"Leaves Allowed.\"\n",

        "          Note: The table header in the image says \"Salary,\" but the question asks for \"Department.\" This formula looks up the ID in the first column and returns the corresponding value from the second column."
